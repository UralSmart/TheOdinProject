    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>The soup is best made a day ahead, giving the flavors time to meld.</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>3 teaspoons extra virgin olive oil or vegetable oil, divided</li>
        <li>1 (1 1/4 pound) section bone-in beef shank with a lot of meat, or 1 pound beef stew meat, excess fat trimmed</li>
        <li>1 large onion, chopped (about 1 1/2 cups)</li>
        <li>8 cups beef broth or beef stock, divided</li>
        <li>4 large beets (about 1 1/2 pounds), peeled and chopped</li>
        <li>4 carrots (1 pound), peeled and chopped</li>
        <li>1 large russet potato (6 ounces), peeled and cut into 1/2-inch cubes</li>
        <li>2 cups thinly sliced cabbage</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
    <li>Heat 2 teaspoons oil in a large, thick-bottomed pot on medium high heat. Add the shank slice or stew beef. Let the beef brown lightly on one side, then turn over.</li>
    <li>Pour 4 cups of the beef broth over the beef and onions in the pot. Bring to a boil. Lower the heat to a simmer. Cover and cook until the meat is falling-off-the-bone tender, about 1 hour and 30 minutes.</li>
    <li>Peel and chop the beets, carrots, and potatoes into 1/2-inch pieces. Toss the beets and carrots with a teaspoon or two of olive oil and spread them out in a single layer on a foil lined roasting pan. Roast in preheated oven for 15 minutes.</li>
    <li>Once the beef has cooked through until tender, remove from the pot, and take the pot off the heat. If you are using a beef shank, remove and discard any bone, connective tissue, and excess fat. Chop the meat into bite sized pieces.</li>
    </ol>
